The system is run on 24V (includes for the input as well as the output) while the arduino is powered up using 7V. In general, relay module is used to control the output which includes the solenoids while the ideas of VDR being used to receive the input signal from the sensors.

* The resistor pair is build to ensure that the voltage input to Arduino is around 5V where it will be safe for the Arduino pin to work with the conveyor system.
